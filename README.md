# Horiseon-Challenge

First challenge to demonstrate the ability to refactor HTML and CSS.

## Description

My motivation for creating this is to demonstrate my ability to refactor HTML and CSS code. It was also to make this website a lot more accessible by adding alt text to images. Now when someone looks at my code they will be able to read it easily and the alt text allows anyone with visual problems to get a description of the image. I have learnt in the process, the best practices used by developers in HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Usage

The following image is a screenshot of the website. It starts with a navigation bar at the top with three options on the far right (they don't currently link to anything.) and a logo of the website of the far left. There is then a large image of a team working together. There are then 3 sections, 1 for each service Horiseon provides: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Mnagement and Social Media Marketing. On the right of the three sections, there are three additional services Horiseon provide they are: Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. The footer of the wesbite is Horiseon's copyright.
